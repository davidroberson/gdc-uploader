# Test Results Summary

## Test Setup
- Created test data with TracSeq-compatible filenames
- Organized files in the expected directory structure (`fastq/` subdirectory)
- Created valid GDC metadata JSON
- Created test script with hardcoded paths

## Test Execution Results

### Test 1: Files Only Check
- **Status**: SKIPPED
- **Reason**: The application has a filename parsing issue that expects specific TracSeq naming conventions
- **Error**: Segmentation fault (exit code 139) due to array index out of bounds

### Test 2: Simulator Mode
- **Status**: PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL
- **Result**: The application runs without crashing when using `--sim` flag
- **Issue**: No TSV output file is generated, causing CWL to report failure
- **Note**: The simulator mode bypasses file checking, avoiding the filename parsing issue

## Known Issues

1. **Filename Format Requirements**: The application expects filenames with at least 4 underscore-separated parts
2. **Directory Structure**: Files must be in specific subdirectories (`fastq/` for FASTQ files)
3. **Output Generation**: The simulator mode may not generate the expected TSV report file

## Recommendations for Seven Bridges

1. Use the `--sim` flag for testing to avoid filename parsing issues
2. Ensure test files follow the TracSeq naming convention if using `--filesonly`
3. The CWL output definition may need adjustment if TSV files aren't generated in simulator mode
4. Consider applying the patch in `/patches/fix-filename-parsing.patch` to handle different filename formats
