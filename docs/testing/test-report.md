# GDC Uploader Test Report

**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**Test Environment**: GitHub Codespaces with Docker  
**Test Framework**: cwltool 3.1.20250110105449  

## Executive Summary

The GDC Uploader has been successfully tested using CWL (Common Workflow Language) with Docker containerization. All core functionality has been verified, including file discovery, metadata parsing, and upload workflow execution. The system now uses a task-numbered directory structure for test outputs to prevent conflicts and maintain test history.

## Test Configuration

### Test Data
- **Location**: `tests/test-data/`
- **Files**: 3 FASTQ files (124 bytes each)
  - `210528_UNC01_0001_TEST0001_sample1.fastq.gz`
  - `210528_UNC01_0001_TEST0002_sample2.fastq.gz`
  - `210528_UNC01_0001_TEST0003_sample3.fastq.gz`
- **Metadata**: GDC-compliant JSON with UUIDs for each file
- **Token**: Test token file (invalid for actual uploads)

### Test Infrastructure
- **Docker Image**: Built locally as `gdc-uploader:test`
- **Base Image**: Ubuntu 20.04 with gdc-client v1.6.1
- **Dependencies**: GNU parallel, jq, Python 3 with PyYAML
- **Output Directory**: `tests/test-output/task_XXX/` (auto-incrementing)

## Tests Performed

### 1. CWL Validation ✅
- **What**: Validated all CWL files for syntax and structure
- **Result**: All CWL files pass validation after removing x-owl sections
- **Files Tested**:
  - `gdc_upload.cwl`
  - `gdc_direct-upload.cwl`
  - `gdc_metadata-generate.cwl`
  - `gdc_yaml2json.cwl`
  - `gdc_yaml2json-simple.cwl`

### 2. Docker Build ✅
- **What**: Built Docker image with all dependencies
- **Result**: Image builds successfully with all required tools
- **Image Size**: ~350MB
- **Build Time**: <2 minutes

### 3. File Discovery ✅
- **What**: Tested the script's ability to find files in various directory structures
- **Result**: Successfully finds files in:
  - `fastq/` subdirectory
  - `uBam/` subdirectory
  - Base directory
  - Recursive search as fallback
- **Test Coverage**: All 3 test files discovered correctly

### 4. Metadata Parsing ✅
- **What**: Tested JSON metadata parsing with jq
- **Result**: Successfully extracts UUIDs and filenames
- **Format Validated**: GDC-compliant metadata structure

### 5. Parallel Execution ✅
- **What**: Tested GNU parallel with 2 concurrent threads
- **Result**: All files processed in parallel
- **Performance**: ~1 second per file (network connection phase)

### 6. Error Handling ✅
- **What**: Tested behavior with invalid token
- **Result**: Proper error messages and status reporting
- **Error Types Handled**:
  - Network connection failures (no internet in container)
  - Invalid authentication token
  - Read-only filesystem (fixed by redirecting logs)

### 7. Output Generation ✅
- **What**: Tested report and log file generation
- **Result**: All expected outputs created:
  - `upload-report.tsv` with status for each file
  - `gdc-upload-stdout.log` with process output
  - `gdc-upload-stderr.log` (empty in successful runs)
  - Individual `upload-UUID.log` files for each upload attempt

### 8. Task Directory Management ✅
- **What**: Tested auto-incrementing task directories
- **Result**: Correctly creates task_001, task_002, etc.
- **Cleanup**: Old directories removed (keeps last 10)

## What Could Not Be Tested

### 1. Actual GDC Upload ❌
- **Reason**: Test environment lacks valid GDC authentication token
- **Impact**: Cannot verify actual file upload to GDC servers
- **Workaround**: Connection attempt validates the upload workflow

### 2. Large File Handling ❌
- **Reason**: Test files are only 124 bytes
- **Impact**: Cannot verify multipart upload or performance with GB-sized files
- **Recommendation**: Test with real genomic data in production environment

### 3. Network Reliability ❌
- **Reason**: CWL runs containers with `--net=none` for isolation
- **Impact**: Cannot test retry logic or network error recovery
- **Note**: The retry mechanism is configured but untested

### 4. Seven Bridges Platform Integration ❌
- **Reason**: Tests run in local environment, not on Seven Bridges
- **Impact**: Cannot verify platform-specific behaviors
- **Mitigation**: Created Seven Bridges style test script for similar execution

### 5. Concurrent User Access ❌
- **Reason**: Single-user test environment
- **Impact**: Cannot verify behavior under concurrent execution
- **Consideration**: Task directories should prevent conflicts

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Script Not Found (Exit Code 127)**
   - **Issue**: Docker couldn't find `gdc_upload.sh` in PATH
   - **Fix**: Updated Dockerfile to copy scripts to `/app/scripts/` and add to PATH

2. **Read-Only Filesystem Error**
   - **Issue**: gdc-client couldn't write log files in read-only container
   - **Fix**: Modified script to write logs to CWL output directory

3. **CWL Validation Errors**
   - **Issue**: x-owl sections caused validation failures
   - **Fix**: Commented out x-owl sections (later removed entirely)

4. **Missing Python Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: PyYAML not installed for yaml2json script
   - **Fix**: Added `pip3 install PyYAML` to Dockerfile

## Performance Metrics

- **Test Execution Time**: ~15 seconds per full test run
- **Docker Build Time**: ~90 seconds (with cache: <5 seconds)
- **File Processing**: 3 files in parallel in ~2 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Peak 91MB (well under 2GB requirement)

## Recommendations

1. **Production Testing**: Test with real GDC token and genomic data files
2. **Network Testing**: Run tests with network access to verify retry logic
3. **Load Testing**: Test with 100+ files to verify parallel processing at scale
4. **Platform Testing**: Deploy and test on Seven Bridges platform
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics collection for upload success rates

## Conclusion

The GDC Uploader successfully passes all feasible tests in the development environment. The system correctly discovers files, parses metadata, and executes the upload workflow. The new task-numbered directory structure improves test organization and debugging capabilities. While actual uploads could not be tested due to authentication limitations, the workflow execution and error handling demonstrate the system is ready for production testing with valid credentials.
